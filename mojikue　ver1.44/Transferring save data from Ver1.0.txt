　　You can move just the "saveXX" files from inside the "mojikue Ver1.0" game
　　folder to this "mojikue Ver1.4x" folder that you have downloaded.
　　Please take care not to move any other files by accident.


　　I believe it is possible to transfer these files, but there is no
　　guarantee that all of the game's functions will work correctly.
	I think there is a possibility that error messages like

　　「ファイル Audio/BGM/○○○○が見つかりません」

　　may appear.
　　In this event, I think you can duplicate the "ダミー" audio file within 
　　the Audio > BGM folder, and rename it to match whatever the ○○○○
　　displayed in the the error message was.


　　Also, it appears that there are some save files whose timestamps cannot
　　be transferred. You will have to give up on these. My apologies.
