　♀Harukaze "Nyanko" Tama 	Type O	：Total tsundere. An all-round athlete, a keen intellect, and a great cook. Behind her harsh manner of speaking, she's nicer than anyone. Beautiful breasts.
　♀Akizora "Tomocchi" Tomoe	Type B	：Reckless. A self-sufficient troublemaker stuffed full of tomboy-ish charm. Despite her loli looks, she has an erotic personality. Lonely breasts.
　♀Kiriu "Hime" Orihime		Type B	：Not a people-person, but wants to be a sharp-minded detective. Often stares off into space. A highly sheltered princess-like girl. Precious breasts.
